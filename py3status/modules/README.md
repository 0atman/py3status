  xrandr                 Control your screen(s) layout easily.
                         
                         This modules allows you to handle your screens outputs directly from your bar!
                             - Detect and propose every possible screen combinations
                             - Switch between combinations using click events and mouse scroll
                             - Activate the screen or screen combination on a single click
                             - It will detect any newly connected or removed screen automatically
                         
                         For convenience, this module also proposes some added features:
                             - Dynamic parameters for POSITION and WORKSPACES assignment (see below)
                             - Automatic fallback to a given screen or screen combination when no more
                                 screen is available (handy for laptops)
                             - Automatically apply this screen combination on start: no need for xorg!
                             - Automatically move workspaces to screens when they are available
                         
                         Configuration parameters:
                             - cache_timeout: how often to (re)detect the outputs
                             - fallback: when the current output layout is not available anymore,
                                 fallback to this layout if available. This is very handy if you
                                 have a laptop and switched to an external screen for presentation
                                 and want to automatically fallback to your laptop screen when you
                                 disconnect the external screen.
                             - force_on_start: switch to the given combination mode if available
                                 when the module starts (saves you from having to configure xorg)
                             - format_clone: string used to display a 'clone' combination
                             - format_extend: string used to display a 'extend' combination

                             - <OUTPUT>_pos: apply the given position to the OUTPUT
                                 Example: DP1_pos = "-2560x0"
                                 Example: DP1_pos = "left-of LVDS1"
                                 Example: DP1_pos = "right-of eDP1"

                             - cache_timeout : how often we refresh this module in seconds
                             - script_path   : script you want to show output of (compulsory)
